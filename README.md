# Coffee-Shop-Website-with-Admin-Panel
I used only HTML, CSS and PHP and MYSQL for this project. Customer will land on the website  using a landing page. Can see menu, order anything from their menu, read blogs and send email to the admin using this website. I have used PHP mailer for the email. Please note that you have to change a bit in the contact.php if you want to use this website. Use your authentic email address and password where you see "Your original email" and "your original password". The admin can upload new menu, handle orders, post blogs, delete menu or blogs and will get to see a chart which will tell him which one of his coffee is the best seller.

I have included my MYSQL DB sql file so that you already have some data in your database. Import the sql file first.
